## Project Abstract

Fashion Finder is a web application for providing clothing and outfit recommendations based on
a user’s clothing interests. Many sites only suggest clothing items based on a user’s most recent search
history, as opposed to items in a user’s closet. With Fashion Finder, users will be able to upload photos of clothing items to their account’s “wardrobe”, from which Fashion Finder’s recommendation engine produces user-specific recommended clothing articles. As clothing recommendations are generated,
they are split into two categories: similar items and complementary items. Similar items are clothing
articles that resemble items uploaded to a user’s wardrobe in both color and style. Complementary
items are clothing items that pair well with items in a user’s wardrobe, creating suggested outfits
tailored to a user’s style. Fashion Finder aims to help its users find entire outfit recommendations with ease.

## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
