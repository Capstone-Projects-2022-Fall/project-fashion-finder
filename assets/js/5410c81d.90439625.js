Firstly a user typically shops on multiple websites, therefore the suggestions on each of those websites are completely different and typically based just off the last few items that they have browsed.  For this reason Fashion Finder takes a different approach by collecting data and saving it to a users account on every item that they have liked for the time-being on their Fashion Finder account.  Another issue users typically face is finding items that go with a specific item that they already own.  To resolve this issue Fashion Finder provides a feature to upload clothing that they own and add that to their Fashion Finder account wardrobe.
