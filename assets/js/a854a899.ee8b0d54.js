When they scroll through the content that is displayed they will be able to like the items that they are interested, which will help us to create a content feed more tailored to each specific user.  The more content a user likes the better our algorithms will be able to create accurate outfit suggestions for each user.  Along with creating completely new outfit suggestions and displaying those to a user, Fashion Finder will also be able to take items that a user already owns, and be able to match those articles of clothing to other pieces that would go well together in an outfit.  All items suggested will be cross checked with StockX to see if they are available on their website and a price evaluation will be done on each item.  Some of these items might not be available on StockX, but they will still be suggested to the user if that user has selected the option to view outsider products also, where they can then look around to find where to purchase that item themselves.

As soon as you start to track an item our software begins to collect data in order to find out when an item is at a good price for you to make a purchase.  Initially when you track an item Fashion Finder will be able to provide several statistics to a user on the price of that item such as its 12 month trade trade, All-Time trade range, the volatility, number of sales, price premium, and the average sale price.  The longer you track an item the more accurate these statistics will be become along with being able to view a graphic chart on showing exactly every sale of that item.  If you are tracking an item and decide to recieve notifications once an item in your size drops to a fair market price you will be the first to receive an update and this will help you to save money on the clothing your most interested in."))}f.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
