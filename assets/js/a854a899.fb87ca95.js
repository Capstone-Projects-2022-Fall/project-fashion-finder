Then, the user will be able to decide if the items they are interested in are being sold at a fair price.

When they scroll through the content that is displayed they will be able to like the items that they are interested, which will help us to create a content feed more tailored to each specific user. The more content a user likes the better our algorithms will be able to create accurate outfit suggestions for each user. Along with creating completely new outfit suggestions and displaying those to a user, Fashion Finder will also be able to take items that a user already owns, and be able to match those articles of clothing to other pieces that would go well together in an outfit. All items suggested will be cross checked with StockX to see if they are available on their website and a price evaluation will be done on each item. Some of these items might not be available on StockX, but they will still be suggested to the user if that user has selected the option to view outsider products also, where they can then look around to find where to purchase that item themselves.

As soon as you start to track an item our software begins to collect data in order to find out when an item is at a good price for you to make a purchase. Initially when you track an item Fashion Finder will be able to provide several statistics to a user on the price of that item such as its 12 month trade price, all-time trade range, the volatility, number of sales, price premium, and the average sale price. The longer you track an item the more accurate these statistics will become along with being able to view a graphic chart showing exactly every sale of that item.

Along with figuring out the correct clothing that each user desires our goal is to help them to find the best price to buy each of these products.  Fashion finder will not only eliminate the need to search multiple websites for clothing options, but also eliminates the need to second guess if you are getting a good deal on the clothing your interested in buying.

Most retail websites use simple algorithms to make suggestions to their users, typically collecting a cache of all of their recently viewed products, and forming suggestions based on similar brand, article of clothing, or color.  Unlike typical retail websites we plan to create an application that will pull fashion ideas from the millions of creaters on Pinterest, instead of just one specific website.  Through our users liking specific items of content we display we can tailor their content feed closer to what they want, while also suggesting entire outfit ideas instead of single articles of clothing.  Along with doing this we will provide a price analysis on the products that are listed on StockX, something that no retail company would ever do.  Most retail websites only collect data on a users cache which has to do with their current browsing session.
