# Introduction

Fashion Finder is a web application for providing clothing and outfit recommendations based on
a user’s clothing interests. Many sites only suggest clothing items based on a user’s most recent search
history, as opposed to items in a user’s closet. With Fashion Finder, users will be able to upload photos
of clothing items to their account’s “wardrobe”, from which Fashion Finder’s recommendation engine
produces user-specific recommended clothing articles. As clothing recommendations are generated,
they are split into two categories: similar items and complementary items. Similar items are clothing
articles that resemble items uploaded to a user’s wardrobe in both color and style. Complementary
items are clothing items that pair well with items in a user’s wardrobe, creating suggested outfits
tailored to a user’s style. Fashion Finder aims to help its users find entire outfit recommendations with
ease.
