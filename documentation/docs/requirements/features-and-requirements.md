# Features and Requirements

## User Accounts

### Login Page

Users will be able to create a new account or login to an existing account. Login security will be managed using Django's authentication module, which can be leveraged to handle unsuccessful logins as well as password resets.

### Account Home Page

Active users will be redirected to a (personalized home page?) upon a successful login. At the top of the home screen will be a naviagation bar with item upload functionality, a greeting to the user_name, and an option to logout. The majority of the home page below the navigation bar will be devoted to outfit recommendations generated from Pinterest.

## My Closet

Users will be able to save clothing item images they upload into a list of items called My Closet. Information about the items color, category, and brand will be stored in a database tracking user clothing item details and preferences. Users will be able to add items recommended by Fashion Finder into their "My Closet" list as well, whether or not they are purchased on third party retailers.

## Recommended Items

Items will be recommended to user accounts based on liked outfits generated from Pinterest. Recommendations will be made using ResNet and Tensorflow to recognize and categorize clothing items as well as label the data, and then Scikit learnâ€™s K nearest neighbor algorithm to generate a similarity score and provide the final recommendation.

### StockX Price Tracking

If the item recommended is available for purchase on StockX, a chart tracking price history will be displayed.
