# Features and Requirements

## Wardrobe Tracker
One of the core features of the application is that the user is able to upload images to the MongoDB database and then later retrieve those images.

**An authenticated user should be able to**
* Upload an image 
  * Of any size (within HTML payload limit)
  * Of type .jpg or .png
* View a mini version of the image in a customized "wardrobe" page
* View the original image in the original uploaded size
## Label prediction
Whenever a user uploads an image, that image will be processed through a machine learning pipeline.

The model that the image will be processed through is loosely derived from VGG16, a machine learning kernel that is popular for image processing. Detail on the training of the file can be found [at this .ipynb file](../../../model/src/ModelTraining3.ipynb) and are covered in the system overview and system block diagram.

The user is able to then see labels (Ex. ["Blouse","Dress","Striped","Jeans","T-Shirt",...]) for each of their fashion pieces, allowing them to see at a glance what types of clothes they have in their closet.
## Palette prediction
Whenever a user uploads an image, that image will be processed through a sklearn-based color detection algorithm. The algorithm will determine where the subject is in an image, and determine the 3 most representatives colors of the image, or a palette.

The user is able to then see the palettes of their uploaded images, and determine whether their wardrobe is lacking in some color or to brain storm what colors go well together.

## Piece-wise Recommendations

### See Pieces Like this
On each of the users uploaded pieces, they should be able to click a link which allows them to see other fashion pieces like theirs.

The results of clicking on this link will be determine based off of the labels generated by the `ImagePredictionMicroservice`.

In order to determine similarity, the recommendation algorithm takes in two parameters, "palette" and "labels". It recommends items with the goal of finding items with similar labels and palettes. The recommendation algorithm is powered by a MongoDB Aggregation pipeline, details are in the System overview document.

### See Complementary Pieces
On each of the users uploaded pieces, they should be able to click a link which allows them to see pieces which have complementary colors .

A set of colors is considered complementary if the colors are not too similar to one another and the two colors together create an ideal distribution of neutral and bright colors.


## Liking / Disliking

A user will be able to view the collection of 40,000 reference images and then "Like" or "Dislike" these images. The user is then able to see a page of their "Liked" images. For each item on this page, they will also be able to click buttons labeled "See Pieces Like this" and "See Complementary Pieces" to jump to a different page.

## Accounts

There will be a user system such that.

A user will be able to
* Create a new account with email, first name, last name, and password field
* Sign out of their account
* Sign back into their account

Additionally, the passwords of the users will never be stored in plain text.
